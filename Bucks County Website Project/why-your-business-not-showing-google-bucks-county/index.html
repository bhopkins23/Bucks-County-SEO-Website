                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Lack of Local SEO Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>Many business owners focus on general marketing but don't understand the specific requirements of local search optimization that Google uses to rank businesses in Bucks County searches.</p>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Incomplete Online Presence Setup</h3>
                    <p>Businesses rush to get online but skip critical steps like claiming directory listings, optimizing for local keywords, and building location-specific content.</p>

                    <p>Websites that don't mention specific Bucks County locations, neighborhoods, or local service areas fail to signal relevance to Google for local searches.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Poor Technical Foundation</h3>
                    <p>Slow loading speeds, mobile-unfriendly designs, and missing schema markup prevent Google from properly understanding and ranking your business.</p>
