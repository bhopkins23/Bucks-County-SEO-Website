                <h2>Mistake #1: Incomplete Google Business Profile</h2>
                
                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Many Bucks County businesses claim their Google Business Profile but leave critical information blank or incomplete. Missing business hours, phone numbers, service areas, or descriptions severely limit visibility.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Why It Hurts Your Business</h3>
                    <p>Google prioritizes complete, detailed business profiles. Incomplete profiles rank lower in "near me" searches and map results, causing potential customers to choose competitors instead.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Complete every section of your Google Business Profile including services, products, hours, photos, and regular updates. Add location-specific keywords for Bucks County areas you serve.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #2: Inconsistent NAP Information</h2>
                
                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Your business Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) appears differently across various websites, directories, and social media platforms. This confuses Google about your actual business details.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Why It Hurts Your Business</h3>
                    <p>Google uses NAP consistency as a trust signal. Inconsistent information makes Google uncertain about your business legitimacy, resulting in lower rankings for local searches in Bucks County.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Audit all your online listings and ensure identical NAP information everywhere. Use the exact same format for your address and phone number across all platforms.</p>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Websites that don't include location-specific keywords like "Doylestown," "Newtown PA," or "Bucks County" fail to signal relevance for local searches that customers actually use.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Why It Hurts Your Business</h3>
                    <p>When someone searches "dentist in Warrington PA," Google looks for websites that mention these locations. Without local keywords, your business won't appear for location-specific searches.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Naturally incorporate Bucks County location names throughout your website content, page titles, and meta descriptions. Create location-specific landing pages for areas you serve.</p>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Websites that load slowly on mobile devices or are difficult to navigate frustrate potential customers and signal poor quality to Google's mobile-first indexing system.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Why It Hurts Your Business</h3>
                    <p>Over 80% of local searches happen on mobile devices. Poor mobile experience leads to high bounce rates and lower rankings, especially for emergency services and immediate needs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Ensure your website loads quickly on mobile, has clear navigation, and makes it easy for customers to call or find your location with one tap.</p>
